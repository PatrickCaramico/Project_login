## resumo

### sobre
<p>The project's idea was to create a login screen, where the user provides a valid email and password. After that, the system will approve the entry and redirect the user to another page, which in this case would be the updated countdown screen, as a test for a future project. On this countdown screen, there is a button to go back and a button to change the theme. The countdown system has been updated, and now, when it reaches the final time, the system resets the countdown, plays a sound, and displays a message to the end user.</p>
